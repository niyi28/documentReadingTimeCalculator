Hey writers! I’ve been loving the feedback that Write Here weekly prompts have been helping you all express yourselves and spark some new creativity in your writing.
But if you’re still feeling stuck in the traps of writer’s block, I highly recommend signing up for our Summer Creator Workshop Series, where we’ll be walking you through how to write a great essay, how to promote your work on social media, and how to finally overcome writer's block! More information about how to register is below:
The workshops are free and recorded, and the best part is that I’ll be teaching the How to Beat Writer’s Block workshop! It’ll be wonderful to work with you all on a more personal level to help you share your words and your voice with the world. So please sign up through the link above and I hope to see you there!
THIS WEEK’S PROMPTS
Write about your small wins
Did you do something cool at work that went overlooked? Finally potty-trained a stubborn toddler? Did you eat a vegetable this week? Tell us what’s making you feel super accomplished and tag “Writehere.”
When you were a kid, what did you think being a grown-up would be like (and how incredibly wrong were you)?
How has adulthood surprised you or is it everything you expected it to be and more? Get in touch with your younger self and tag “Writehere” in your essays about what it really means to be a grown-up.
How have you changed in the last year?
A lot can happen in a year: birth, death, a whole pandemic. How has your life changed since this time last year? Are things better? Worse? Think about it and tell us what you learned by tagging “Writehere.” *Hint hint* Your response to this prompt may also count toward The Medium Writers Challenge!
