I am very interested in the job position at Aurora Energy Research in Austin and believe, I have the right combination of skills, experience, and personality to succeed in the role. I am intrigued by your company's analytical input in the energy ecosystem, especially in Europe, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Australia.
I have always been an energy enthusiast since the fourth year of my bachelor's studies in chemical engineering. The interest was directed towards providing sustainable energy solutions to developing countries like Nigeria.
My passion for energy conversion systems aided my decision to enroll in the master's program in Process, Energy, Environmental, and Systems Engineering at the Technical University of Berlin. During my master’s thesis, I took United States of America as one of the case studies subjects for natural gas-hydrogen mix in gas turbines. The research exposed me to the energy transition strategies, huge potential of the United States of America’s clean energy and massive future hydrogen market. 
I am often curious about novel energy technologies, the consequences of present/foreseeable energy policies on the dynamics of the energy space, and the optimal solutions required to achieve country-specific climate change goals in 2030 and 2050. I believe this job provides a platform to build on my curiosity as I diligently carry out the required task of the job position.
